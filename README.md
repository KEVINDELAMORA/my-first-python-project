# Book Tracker

This simple command-line application lets you keep a list of books you've read.

## Usage

Run the script with Python and one of the subcommands:

```
python book_tracker.py add "Book Title"   # Add a book
python book_tracker.py list                # Show all books
python book_tracker.py remove "Book Title" # Remove a book
```

Books are stored in `books.json` in the same directory as the script.
